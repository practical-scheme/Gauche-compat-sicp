Provide minimum set of compatibility features required to run
code in SICP.

This is a sort of "backburner" project---there's not much yet.
Whatever you found missing, send PR.

Once we get enough meat, I'll bundle this to the Gauche distribution.

# How to use

Clone the repo, or download zip and extract.  Then:

    $ ./configure
    $ make install

Now, in gosh prompt or Gauche script you can use `compat.sicp`:

    gosh> (use compat.sicp)
